# ðŸ“Š Risk Evaluation Engine using Natural Sensitivities

## Introduction

This presentation showcases the usage of a Mathematica-based environment developed by Olivier Croissant to evaluate the risk of derivatives portfolios using an extended notion of **natural sensitivities**.

## Theoretical Foundations

The mathematical backbone of this approach is based on a *Natural Sensitivities Algebra* that allows transformation of first and second-order sensitivities between variable sets, encapsulating:

- Chain-rule-based transformation of sensitivities
- Tensor notation for second-order risk
- Sensitivity propagation across model changes
